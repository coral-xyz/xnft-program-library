Quickstart repo for building your own xNFT.

## Developing

Once you've installed Backpack, get started building your xNFT with these steps.

### Install

First, install dependencies.

```
yarn
```

### Run the dev server

Then, run the dev server with hot reloading

```
yarn dev
```

### Open the Simulator in Backpack

Now that you have your xNFT dev server running, open it in the Backpack simulator to see it run.

That's it!
